### Admins can find KGs NPCs that wander around a bit easier. Server & Admin Client. No version checking. Configurable Hotkey.
---
### Things to know
```
- The mod must be installed on the server to read the adminlist and sync admin status to the client. 
- Updating the admin list will automatically sync that change to a client if their id was added.
- The Admin client must have the mod, or they will not have any functionality.
- The mod searches for all npcs within your loaded area. 
- I made this mod in like 10 minutes, so it's not very efficient if there are a lot of NPCs in your area.

Before you ask, Single Player mode = Auto Admin status.
```
`NOTE:` I recommend that you change your keyboard shortcuts via the [Offical BepInEx Configuration Manager](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/Official_BepInEx_ConfigurationManager/)

Also, before you ask, yes...you can change the configuration via the file and not using the manager and it will update live in the game.


## Config Options
`[Hotkey]`
 - The shortcut used to toggle the npc window on and off. The key can be overridden by a game-specific plugin if necessary, in that case this setting is ignored. [Not Synced with Server]
   - Setting type: KeyboardShortcut
   - Default value: 
     - F + LeftControl
